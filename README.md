**Work in progress!** This project aims to recreate source code for ***The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks*** by decompiling its code by hand. **The repository does not contain assets or assembly code.** To build the ROM, you must own an existing
copy of the game to extract assets from.

> [!NOTE]
> The project targets the European and Japanese versions, and other versions might be supported later.
